    "The generalized approach I like to take to data cleaning are:\n",
    "1. Remove irrelevant data\n",

    "4. Fill or remove missing values\n",

    "\n",
    "My preferred approach to folder organization is to have 3 folders: \n",
    "- INPUT: All my raw input data. I will rarely save edited files here.\n",
    "- OUTPUT: All my code outputs and intermediate files.\n",
    "- CODE: All my code will be in this folder. This is the folder I push to git. I like to label the use of my codes based on their function. Example of this\n",
    "    - 'DATA' for scripts that organize data.\n",
    "    - \"ANA\" for scripts that are used for analysis.\n",
    "    - \"FIG\" for scripts that generate figures.\n",
    "    - \"MODEL\" for model wrapper scripts.\n",
    "    - \"FUN\" for functions that other scripts call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling files from INPUTS or OUTPUT folders, using absolute paths is more reliable and easier to debug. Relative paths are more flexible and often requires smaller blocks of code. However, it's good practice to use absolute paths but ultimately it's based on preference. "

    "The USGS has a library called 'dataRetrieval' which helps with loading hydrologic and water quality data into Python. dataRetrieval library was originally built for R, and has better documentation. But they do have a python version, which is what we will use. \n",

    "We want to compile inorganic nitrogen fraction and discharge. With this we see that we have dissolved fraction of Inorganic nitrogen (nitrate and nitrite) and discharge. The units are likely mg/L as N and ft3/s, but we need to double check. You always want to double check your data to make sure you are pulling the **right** data and that you understand **what** you are pulling. It sounds trivial, but this is how mistakes happen. "

    "**Removing outliers is more an art than a science.**\n",

    "Removing data from a dataset can be tricky. In part because you do not want to bias your data by removing concentrations that hold information about the watershed. For example, for a nitrogen-rich watershed low flow (baseflow) might have really high concentrations. If we were to remove those concentrations, we could lose all the information about the low flow part of the watershed's hydrograph! \n",
    "\n",
    "Those maximum values are also very high for mg/L as N! background concentrations in rivers is about 1 mg-N/L, but it can be lower. Maximum concentrations are around 30 mg-N/L. Therefore, concentrations a whole magnitude above is definitely problematic. We need to remove those. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also see minimum concentrations at 0.001 mg-N/L. That is likely the lower detection limit for the instruments. While there are standards set by EPA these limits change based on instrumentation used. Based on what I could find, currently for the USGS, the limit is 0.02 mg-N/L. We don't want to remove these data because they still hold information, but it can mess up your statistics. So let's quantify how non-detects each station has, in case we want to remove some stations from our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways you can remove outliers, and some are better suited for some data distributions than others. We know that a lot of envirionmental/hydrological data has a log-distributions (skewed and heavy tails), thus removing outliers based on a normal distribution might remove non-outliers. Try out a few different approaches and pick the one that maintains the distribution of your data but removes some values that are likely erroneous. "

LOADEST model), and I encourage you to look into those methods.\n",

Obviously this should be done with caution, but for this first step in data exploration we'll make the assumption that manure and fertilizer inputs don't drastically from year to year.
